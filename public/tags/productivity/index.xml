      <description>‚ÄúFill your paper with the breathings of your heart.‚Äù ‚Äì William Wordsworth
 I have recently taken to the habit of journaling. I have come to appreciate the process of putting your thoughts on paper, and I hope I can convince you to do the same üß† üìÑ
Why Journal? Journaling as a practice has enormous benefits. The main one that attracted me, was that it helps declutter and lapidify your thoughts.</description>

      <description>Motivation has a shelf life. It changes like the weather. Although it is a seasonal phenomenon, it still carries a great deal of power.
In this blog post, I aim to explain how you can motivate yourself to do hard habits, even though you may feel low.
Step One: Genuinely be interested in whatever you want to pursue. You cannot be internally motivated to do anything when you do not like doing it.</description>

      <description>This is a legendary book, its reputation proceeds it. All the productivity greats like Thomas Frank and Ali Abdaal have recommended it‚Ä¶so this month I have decided to check it out.
And boy, does it deliver.
Core ideas First, I think we should define what an ‚ÄúAtomic Habit‚Äù really is. Many of us think that to be successful, we should do great feats‚Ä¶but in fact, that is not true at all!</description>

      <description>I am writing this blog post at 11:55 AM out of a great need to express my thoughts about sleep,the tame death that envelopes us all.
I find that in our modern world,sleep is often put aside,or even overlooked. I have recently found a study by the american goverment that asserts that 1 in 3 adults are chronically sleep deprived. These numbers are shocking and should make us reconsider our view on sleep.</description>

      <description>Productivity books, we all read them kinda is becoming my guilty pleasure at this point. However, I have to give the book ‚ÄúDeep Work‚Äù some credit. Although this is my second reading, I still find enormous meaning from it.
The book is a non-fiction thesis on how ‚Äúknowledge work‚Äù is valued in the economy, and how top achievers actually succeed. It also tackles the idea of ‚Äúinformation overload‚Äù in our modern digital age.</description>
