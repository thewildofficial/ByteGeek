      <description>Typing has become and exceedingly useful skill over the last few years. My journey started with a single link. A friend wanted to compare our typing speeds. At the time, i was pretty slow, having to look down at my keyboard every time I wanted to type a single character (I cringe at the thought, in retrospect). At the time, everyone were much faster than me, I was at a slow 25 WPM and didn&amp;rsquo;t care much about it.</description>
