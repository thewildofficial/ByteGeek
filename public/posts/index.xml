<p>but how do you become one?</p>
<p>In this resource guide,i will try to tackle this question by indentifying a few essential <em>skills and websites</em> that helped (and is continuing to help) me learn how to hack.</p>
<h1 id="1-googling">1. googling</h1>
<p>This is one of the most underrated and valuable skills to have as someone who works with computers.being able to <em>find information</em> and <em>research</em> will certainly get you further in the cybersphere.</p>
<h1 id="2-linux">2. Linux</h1>
<p>Anyone who aspires to become a hacker <strong>must</strong> have atleast a passable knowledge of linux.although you could work with operating systems like Windows or MacOS,it is ill advised because <em>most tools and framework</em> are made for linux in specific.</p>
<p>popular hacking (more commonly called as &ldquo;pentesting&rdquo;) frameworks like Kali linux or ParrotOS have a lot of tools built-in,which is very convenient</p>
<h1 id="3-capture-the-flag">3. Capture the flag</h1>
<p>Now we are starting to enter the more interesting stuff!</p>
<p>capture the flag (CTFs) are minigames that are hosted on a platform to enable hackers to practice their skills in a safe environment.
Most CTFs have a system wherein you have to enumerate a system and find a certain file or so-called &ldquo;flag&rdquo;</p>
<p>one of my favorite CTF is the <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">over the wire</a>,and it really helped me starting off</p>
<h1 id="4tryhackme-boxes">4.TryHackMe boxes</h1>
<p><a href="https://tryhackme.com/">TryHackMe</a> is an excellent website to start understanding tools and frameworks.
They have amazing rooms like the metasploit and nmap walkthroughs that really help you grasp how a tool or a framework works.</p>
<p>You can also go down one of their <a href="https://tryhackme.com/paths">learning paths</a>,which will have you understanding a concept at a deeper level.</p>
<h1 id="where-next">Where Next?</h1>
<p>assuming you have done all of the above,you can say with certainity that you have <strong>mastered the basics of hacking.</strong></p>
<p>ðŸŽŠ  congrats!
your next step might be researching about fun domains like <strong>Bug bounties</strong> or <strong>freelance pentesting</strong></p>
<p>else,you may also want to do rooms (similar to TryHackMe) on <a href="https://app.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a></p>
