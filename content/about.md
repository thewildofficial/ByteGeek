## Hi :wave:

I'm Aban,but you will see me online as Wild.
I'm a 15 year old programmer on a quest to conquer the Cyber Security/AI world.

This Blog is intended to document my journey to become a *semi competent hacker/programmer* while having a lot of fun along the way.

you can reach out to me via [email](mailto:abanstampy@gmail.com).

 you can also check out my [book](https://www.amazon.in/Perspective-Artificial-Intelligence-Aban-Hasan/dp/1678985988).

I just completed my Grade 10,and happy to have been chosen as the [valedictorian](https://www.daijiworld.com/news/newsDisplay?newsID=822153). You can see my awesome picture there (try spotting me!)

I have also made a start up [company](https://cosectechinnovate.wixsite.com/cosec) with a few friends,which is in its infancy.
