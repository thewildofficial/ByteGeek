## times have changed.
today,the man who can adapt the fastest and handle the most information is the man who wins.

this shift in focus of the economy from physical labour to *intellectual* labour has created an industry around learning,in contrast to education.

this industry is what i like to call,the **absorb and learn** niche,which serves information through media like:
- watchable courses (youtube,udemy,skillshare and the plathera of other course providers)
- pamplets and books 
- certifications

All these options,makes it more difficult to choose a medium and stick with it.Personally,i find myself searching on sites rather than actually doing some deliberate practice
