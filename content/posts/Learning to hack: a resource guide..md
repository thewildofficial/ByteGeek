## **Being a hacker sounds really cool.**
but how do you become one?

In this resource guide,i will try to tackle this question by indentifying a few essential *skills and websites* that helped (and is continuing to help) me learn how to hack.

# 1. googling
This is one of the most underrated and valuable skills to have as someone who works with computers.being able to *find information* and *research* will certainly get you further in the cybersphere.

# 2. Linux
Anyone who aspires to become a hacker **must** have atleast a passable knowledge of linux.although you could work with operating systems like Windows or MacOS,it is ill advised because *most tools and framework* are made for linux in specific.

popular hacking (more commonly called as "pentesting") frameworks like Kali linux or ParrotOS have a lot of tools built-in,which is very convenient

# 3. Capture the flag 
Now we are starting to enter the more interesting stuff!

capture the flag (CTFs) are minigames that are hosted on a platform to enable hackers to practice their skills in a safe environment.
Most CTFs have a system wherein you have to enumerate a system and find a certain file or so-called "flag"

one of my favorite CTF is the [over the wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/),and it really helped me starting off

# 4.TryHackMe boxes
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) is an excellent website to start understanding tools and frameworks. 
They have amazing rooms like the metasploit and nmap walkthroughs that really help you grasp how a tool or a framework works.

You can also go down one of their [learning paths](https://tryhackme.com/paths),which will have you understanding a concept at a deeper level.
# Where Next?
assuming you have done all of the above,you can say with certainity that you have **mastered the basics of hacking.** 



:confetti_ball:  congrats!
your next step might be researching about fun domains like **Bug bounties** or **freelance pentesting**

else,you may also want to do rooms (similar to TryHackMe) on [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu/)
